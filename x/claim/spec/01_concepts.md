The users are required to claim their airdrop by participating in two core network activities and in two actions related to the NFTID and the Vault.

* 20% is claimed by staking (every amount is ok)
* 20% is claimed by voting in governance
* 20% is claimed by creating an NFTID
* 20% is claimed by interacting with the Rebus Vault (every amount is ok)

At initial, module stores all airdrop users with amounts from genesis inside KVStore.

After 8 months from launch all unclaimed airdrop tokens are sent to the community pool.
